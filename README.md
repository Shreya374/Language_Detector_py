# Language Detector

A Jupyter Notebook‑based tool for detecting the natural language(s) of given text input. Detect languages, estimate confidence, and explore different detection methods — useful for multilingual NLP pipelines, content filtering, preprocessing, etc.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Language Detector is a project built in a Jupyter Notebook that reads text input (sentences, paragraphs, or documents) and predicts which natural language(s) the input is written in. It supports confidence scores, works with short and longer texts, and allows comparison of different detection algorithms.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Detect language of a given text (single sentence, paragraph, etc.)
* Provide confidence / probability scores for predictions
* Compare multiple detection methods (e.g. `langdetect`, `langid`, FastText, custom ML models)
* Handle mixed‑language input or ambiguous text
* Support non‑Latin scripts (e.g. Indic languages) if data & models available
* Interactive: explore results visually in notebook (charts, confusion matrices, etc.)

---

## 🛠 Technologies & Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Libraries/tools (depending on implementation):
    • `langdetect`
    • `langid`
    • FastText / pre‑trained models
    • `pycountry` for language code/name mappings
    • Data manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`
    • Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn` or similar

## 🧪 Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/language-detector.git
   cd language-detector
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/Language_Detector.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the notebook cells: load sample texts, run detection methods, visualize results.

5. (Optional) Use `src/detector.py` (if provided) for programmatic detection in other scripts.

## 📊 Evaluation & Metrics

To help assess how well the detector works, the notebook includes:

* Confusion matrix (which languages are most commonly confused)
* Precision, recall, F1‑score for each language class
* Performance on short text vs long text
* Speed / runtime comparisons (if multiple methods are used)

---

## ⚠️ Limitations & Challenges

* Very short texts (one or two words) are difficult to classify with high confidence
* Mixed‑language sentences or code‑mixed input can confuse the models
* Some languages/scripts may have limited sample/text data, reducing accuracy
* Heavy models (e.g. FastText, large pretrained models) may use more memory/time

---

## 🛣 Roadmap & Possible Improvements

* Add more languages/scripts (especially Indic, African, etc.)
* Fine‑tune or train custom models for better accuracy on under‑represented languages
* Improve detection of mixed‑language text
* Build a lightweight version for real‑time / low‑resource applications
* Wrap detection logic into a simple API / web interface

If you like, I can also generate a **short version** (for GitHub project description / “About” section) + some nice badges you can use. Do you want that?
